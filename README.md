# vscode-allofthem

This extension adds a Save All and Close All buttons to the file editor navigation bar, and a Save All context menu entry for editor tabs in VS Code. There are no settings or commands for this extension, it uses the built-in commands for closeAllEditors and files.saveFiles and just adds a shortcut button for them.
